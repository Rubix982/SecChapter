# Auto Scaling and Load Balancing

## Objective
    
Implement auto scaling and load balancing for EC2 instances.

## Steps

1. Create a launch configuration defining instance specifications
2. Set up an auto scaling group to automatically adjust the number of instances based on load metrics
3. Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across instances in the auto scaling group
4. Test by generating traffic and observing how auto scaling reacts to changes in load
