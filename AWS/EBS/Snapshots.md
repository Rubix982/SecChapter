# Snapshots

## Incremental Backup

EBS snapshots are incremental, meaning only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are saved, which can
save time and storage costs.

## Cross-Region And Cross-Account

Snapshots can be copied across regions and accounts, enhancing data availability and durability.

## Lifecycle Management

Automate snapshot management by defining policies to create, retain, and delete snapshots.
