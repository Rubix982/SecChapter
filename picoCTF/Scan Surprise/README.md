# Scan Surprise

## Description

I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead?
You can download the challenge files here: [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_atlas/1/challenge.zip)

This CTF requires starting an instance. For example,

1. The same files are accessible via SSH here, `ssh -p 54855 ctf-player@atlas.picoctf.net`
2. Using the password `83dcefb7`. Accept the fingerprint with `yes`, and `ls` once connected to begin. Remember, in a shell, passwords are hidden!
