# Chats

I tried conversing with ChatGPT to find out how to use these different tools -- and sadly, setting up many of the tools that it recommend is just ... time-consuming on MacOS.

I am strongly considering saving my chats with ChatGPT here because it does give good suggestions, and since I am learning, I need to document all that I see and hear and read.
