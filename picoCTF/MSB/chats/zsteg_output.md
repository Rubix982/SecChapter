# Zsteg Output

## Question

I have an interesting output from zsteg,

```sh
➜  MSB git:(main) ✗ zsteg Ninja-and-Prince-Genji-Ukiyoe-Utagawa-Kunisada.flag.png 
imagedata           .. text: "~~~|||}}}"
b1,g,lsb,xy         .. file: Common Data Format (Version 2.5 or earlier) data
b1,g,msb,xy         .. file: Common Data Format (Version 2.5 or earlier) data
b2,r,lsb,xy         .. text: ["U" repeated 8 times]
b2,g,lsb,xy         .. file: Matlab v4 mat-file (little endian) ��������, numeric, rows 4294967295, columns 4294967295
b2,g,msb,xy         .. file: Matlab v4 mat-file (little endian) UUUUUUUU, numeric, rows 4294967295, columns 4294967295
b2,b,lsb,xy         .. text: ["U" repeated 8 times]
b4,r,lsb,xy         .. text: ["w" repeated 8 times]
b4,r,msb,xy         .. text: ["U" repeated 12 times]
b4,g,msb,xy         .. text: ["w" repeated 16 times]
b4,b,lsb,xy         .. text: "\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"4DC\""
b4,b,msb,xy         .. text: "wwwwwwww3333"
```

## Answer

The output from zsteg suggests the PNG file contains several interesting patterns in its Least Significant Bit (LSB) and Most Significant Bit (MSB) planes. Here’s a breakdown of what the results might mean and how you can investigate further:

Key Observations from zsteg Output
	1.	Text Patterns in Image Data
	•	"~~~|||}}}" (in imagedata): This could be a deliberate steganographic message or random data in the image’s pixel values.
	2.	Binary Patterns in LSB and MSB
	•	b1,g,lsb,xy: Indicates a potential Common Data Format (CDF) file hidden in the green channel’s LSB.
	•	b2,g,lsb,xy and b2,g,msb,xy: Suggest the presence of a Matlab v4 mat-file with absurd dimensions (4294967295 rows and columns). This might be corrupted or intentionally misleading data.
	3.	Repetitive Character Strings
	•	b2,r,lsb,xy, b4,r,msb,xy: Repeated “U” or “w” characters may hint at ASCII encoding of some data.
	•	b4,b,lsb,xy and b4,b,msb,xy: "4DC" and "3333" could indicate encoded data.

Steps to Investigate Further

1. Extract Hidden Data
	•	Use zsteg’s extraction capability for specific layers and channels.
Example:

zsteg -E b1,g,lsb,xy Ninja-and-Prince-Genji-Ukiyoe-Utagawa-Kunisada.flag.png > extracted_cdf.dat

	•	Extract the potential CDF file from the b1,g,lsb,xy layer.
Similarly, extract the potential Matlab v4 file:

zsteg -E b2,g,lsb,xy Ninja-and-Prince-Genji-Ukiyoe-Utagawa-Kunisada.flag.png > extracted_matlab.mat

2. Analyze Extracted Data
	•	For CDF Data: Use file to determine the format and strings to identify human-readable text.

file extracted_cdf.dat
strings extracted_cdf.dat


	•	For Matlab File: Open in MATLAB or use matlab.engine in Python to inspect the contents.

3. Inspect the Text Patterns

Repeated characters (e.g., "UUUUUUUU", "wwwwwwww") often indicate encoded data. Use tools like:
	•	CyberChef: Analyze encoding schemes (Base64, Hex, etc.).
	•	Python Script:

data = "UUUUUUUU"  # Example
for encoding in ['utf-8', 'ascii', 'latin-1']:
    try:
        print(data.encode(encoding))
    except Exception as e:
        pass

4. Investigate Other Channels

Other channels (red, green, blue) and bit planes might also hold data. For instance:
	•	Extract b4,r,msb,xy to investigate "U" repetitions.

zsteg -E b4,r,msb,xy Ninja-and-Prince-Genji-Ukiyoe-Utagawa-Kunisada.flag.png > extracted_text.txt

5. Verify the Metadata
	•	Use exiftool to check for any suspicious metadata or appended data in the PNG file.

exiftool Ninja-and-Prince-Genji-Ukiyoe-Utagawa-Kunisada.flag.png

6. Check for Overlays
	•	Use tools like stegsolve to visually inspect layers for anomalies or hidden messages.

java -jar stegsolve.jar

Hypotheses
	1.	Steganographic Content:
	•	The patterns ("~~~|||}}}", "UUUUUUUU", etc.) and detected file signatures suggest the presence of hidden data.
	2.	Decoy or Corrupted Data:
	•	Unusual dimensions in the Matlab file could be a decoy or result of intentional corruption to mislead analysis.
	3.	Embedded Files:
	•	The detected CDF and Matlab formats might contain further embedded data or clues.
