# tunn3l v1s10n

## Category

Forensics.

## Description

We found this [file](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/21c07c9dd20cd9f2459a0ae75d99af6e/tunn3l_v1s10n). Recover the flag.

## Solution

Download the file,

```sh
curl -O https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/21c07c9dd20cd9f2459a0ae75d99af6e/tunn3l_v1s10n
```

The updated `BMP` file is stored in this directory. I read the Wikipedia page, but I realise I need more patience to go through these kind of problems. I was unable to figure out how to update the width and height exactly to solve the problem to find the actual flag.

Luckily, I found a good tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H7OWAc1nY4&t=569s) on how to do that.

Flag -> `picoCTF{qu1t3_a_v13w_2020}`.
