# Dear Diary

## Description

If you can find the flag on this disk image, we can close the case for good! Download the disk image [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/63/disk.flag.img.gz).

## Solution

Honestly, spent an hour tinkering with commands on MacOS and even wrote an Ubuntu Docker file, but to no avail, I only messed up the disk image file more and more.

I looked up the Sleuth Kit, and I re-wrote the docker file to use a `Kali Linux` base instead, but I am running out of time for today, so I am going to give my resignation here.

The flag is `picoCTF{1_533_n4m35_80d24b30}`, [thanks to this blog post](https://infosecwriteups.com/picoctf-2024-write-up-forensics-c471e79e6af9#4cfa).

I will come back to this problem and add more detailed steps on how to solve this exactly.
