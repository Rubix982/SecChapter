    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      The `exec` command may be used to gain shell access, or run other commands, in a Pod's container. While this can
      be useful for troubleshooting purposes, it could represent an attack vector and is discouraged to use in the
      `vault` namespace. This policy blocks Pod exec commands to Pods in a Namespace called `vault`.
