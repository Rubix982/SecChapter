# 🎊 Kubernetes Goat Community

Hey Folks!! 👋

This project has grown a lot since its inception and its all because of the support from community. 🙏

The least we can do for the community is open up a space where everyone can come together to talk, learn and build more awesome stuff around Kubernetes Goat. 🌱

So, here it is **Kubernetes Goat Meets Discord**. 🚀
