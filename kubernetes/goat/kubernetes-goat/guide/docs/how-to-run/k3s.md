# ☸️ K3S - Lightweight Kubernetes

The docker container runtime must be used to complete some of the included scenarios. K3s uses containerd by default, so adding docker support requires the following steps during installation

-  Ensure docker version is up-to-date. Reference this repo [https://github.com/rancher/install-docker](https://github.com/rancher/install-docker)

```bash
curl https://releases.rancher.com/install-docker/20.10.sh | sh
```

- Change `cgroup` to `cgroupfs` because k3s does not use systemd cgroup

```bash
echo -e '{\n  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=cgroupfs"]\n}' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

- Install k3s on server with docker option

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s server --docker
SERVER_NAME=$(hostname)  # or enter your local IP address
NODE_TOKEN=$(cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token)
```

- Install k3s on agent with docker option

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://${SERVER_NAME}:6443 K3S_TOKEN=${NODE_TOKEN} sh -s agent --docker
```

:::info

Keep in mind that your system architecture affects the scenarios (e.g., you will need to download a different docker binary to complete the docker-in-docker scenario).

- Now we have the Kubernetes Goat setup up and running, refer to [Getting Started for next steps](../getting-started.md)
