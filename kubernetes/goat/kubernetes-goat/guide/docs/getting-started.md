### Access Kubernetes Goat home

:::info

Here we are going to expose the running pods and deployments locally using the `port-forward` command to locally access the Kubernetes Goat resources.

:::

- If you have not already setup or deployed the Kuberntes Goat resources into your cluster, refer to [How to run Kubernetes Goat](how-to-run/kubernetes-goat-on-kubernetes)

- Ensure the pods are running before running the access script

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

- Run the following command to access the environment by exposing the services via `port-forward`. Make sure you are running this command from the `Kubernetes-goat` home directory

```bash
bash access-kubernetes-goat.sh
```
