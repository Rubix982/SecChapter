# ðŸ“– Learning Kubernetes

[**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io) is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The open source project is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/about)).

## What is Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

## Kubernetes Overview

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

Below are very high-level components in Kubernetes Cluster

**Control Plane Components**

- API Server
- etcd
- Scheduler
- Controller Manager

**Node Components**

- kubelet
- Network Proxy (kube-proxy)
- Container runtime

**Add-Ons**

- DNS
- Container Resource Monitoring
- Cluster-level Logging

## The Illustrated Childrenâ€™s Guide to Kubernetes

The Illustrated Childrenâ€™s Guide to Kubernetes is a simple, gentle answer a father gave his daughter when she inquisitively asked about Kubernetes. Itâ€™s dedicated to all the parents who try to explain software engineering to their children. The star of The Illustrated Childrenâ€™s Guide to Kubernetes, Phippy and her friends explain the core concepts of Kubernetes in simple terms.
